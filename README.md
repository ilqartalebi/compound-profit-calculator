# compound-profit-calculator

**pyqt6 is needed for running this proggram


basic idea is to use this function:
m*(1+0.x)^Y
m = the money youre engageing
x = youre estimated profit for example: 70% gaine==> 0.7
y = is the number of cycles the profit repeats


**please be aware that this program is just calculating ideal and not achievable profit curve
  trade with risk management at your own risk.
